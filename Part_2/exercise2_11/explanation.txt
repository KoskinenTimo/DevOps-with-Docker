I created development environment where I you can just start it by going to link root above.
Changes done in editor are moved to the container with the volumes. NGINX is used to route
via localhost:8080 to api and client. Client location "/" needed settings for the header for 
socket error, settings are:
  proxy_http_version 1.1;
  proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
  proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";

Client requires now ENV variable where the new localhost:8080/api. Added nodemon -L index.js"
to api start because previously when troubleshooting this, it doesn't update changes without -L
atleast in my environment. To get react to push changes to browser and containers, I used
"start": "CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true react-scripts start" as suggested in course Discord channel.
